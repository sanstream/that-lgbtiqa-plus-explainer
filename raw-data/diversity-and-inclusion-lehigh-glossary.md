This terminology sheet was originally created by Eli R. Green and Erica N. Peterson of the LGBT Resource
Center at the University of California, Riverside Ò 2003­2004 and has been revised using resources from the
following organizations: University of California, Riverside; MIT; University of California, Berkeley; George
Washington University; California State University, San Marco; University of California, San Diego; Bowling
Green State University; The Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), and Wikipedia. The staff of
the Pride Center for Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity at Lehigh University have looked over these
definitions and made some revisions.

**Ace**: Someone who identifies as asexual.
**Agender**: A person without gender. An agender individual’s body does not necessarily correspond with their lack of gender

**Demiromantic**: A person who does not experience romantic attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with
someone.
**Demisexual**: A person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with

system. Genderqueer individuals may or may not pursue any physical changes, such as hormonal or surgical intervention,
and may not identify as trans*.
**Grey Ace**: Someone who identifies as part of the asexual community but does not identify as completely asexual. This

really belong to their gender but is merely passing as that gender.
